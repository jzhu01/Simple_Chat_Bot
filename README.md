# Simple_Chat_Bot
A set of java/python programs designed to run a simple chat bot. A python program (included to test my python coding skills) should sort out jargon in a list of words to create another list that can be read into the main java file. Will also attempt my first try at unit testing with Java, not sure how well it will work.
